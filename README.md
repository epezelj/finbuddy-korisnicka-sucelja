**1. ABOUT THE APPLICATION**

**Project title:**
FinBuddy – A simple web application to help you track your personal finances.

**Problem Statement:**
Many of us struggle to see exactly where our money goes. While bank applications show balances and broad categories, they don’t break down spending by item, offer insights into event-based expenses, or provide custom time period summaries. Without this detailed visibility, it’s hard to spend with intention.

**Target Users:**
FinBuddy is designed for budget-conscious consumers, such as students, families or anyone who wants an easy way to track their spending and make smarter financial decisions.

**Proposed Solution:**
With FinBuddy, each user gets a private account where they can monitor their bank and cash balances, log incomes and expenses, and analyze spending trends over selected time period.

**Idea:**
We want to provide a simple and straightforward way for both ourselves and others to understand where we are spending our money.
